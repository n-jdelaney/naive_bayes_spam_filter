# A Simple Multinomial Naive Bayes SMS Spam Filter
## Introduction
According to the website [Robokiller.com](https://www.robokiller.com/spam-text-insights), Americans receive, on average, 357,179,513 spam messages per day. Representing a serious issue for cell phone usage in the U.S., algorithms to screen spam messages apart from messages from people are necessary to deal with extreme volume of incoming messages. 

The goal of this project is to develop a SMS Spam Filter using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. In this project, we use data from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection) with 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified as `spam` or `ham` (non-spam) by humans. 
## Usage
Contained fully in the notebook [naive_bayes_spam_filter.ipynb](./naive_bayes_spam_filter.ipynb), this project is primarily demonstrative of the Bayes algorithm and is not fully deployable.
